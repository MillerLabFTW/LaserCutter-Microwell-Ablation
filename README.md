We have custom modified a commercial SeeMeCNC laser cutter to selectively ablate microwell structures in PDMS. Using the modified laser cutter and our python scripts, you can print hexagonally packed arrays of microwells.


### Documentation
This git repository includes:
- STL files for 3D printing custom parts for the laser cutter
- Current Marlin firmware (modified Marlin for laser cutters courtesy of Tim Schmidt, Lansing-Maker-Network)
- Python scripts for G-code creation
- Wiring Diagram for electronics configuation (based on RAMBo electronics)
- Instructions for operating the laser cutter
- Bill of Materials

The initial influence for using a laser cutter to ablate conical microwells comes from Roger Kamm's group at MIT:

Tim Schmidt from the Lansing Makers Network developed the custom Marlin firmware for controlling a laser cutter.
