GCODE Primer for Laser Cutter Control
General Information
Gcode is a very simple code designed to control 3D printers. We have an adapted version of a GCODE interpreter courtesy of Tim Schmidt from the Lansing Makers Network (https://github.com/lansing-makers-network/buildlog-lasercutter-marlin) that has been augmented to better control laser based machines like our laser cutter. 
 
The flow of Gcode is fairly simple. Commands are given line by line with appropriate arguments. For example, a typical move command would look like this:

“G0 X1 Y2 Z3 F1000”
 
The initial command G0 specifies the function G0 to be applied. The following arguments are comprised of an initial letter to describe the type of argument, and a numerical value to quantify the argument. For example, the letters X, Y, and Z denote coordinates in the X, Y, and Z directions respectively. The numbers following X, Y, and Z show the coordinate value to move towards. The F value is a different argument, which specifies the movement speed. So 1000 quantifies how fast to move for this variable.
 
The Gcode RepRap wiki (http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code) gives a fairly comprehensive list of Gcode commands and appropriate descriptions. There are different Gcode interpreters including our interpreter (Marlin).
 
Interpreter firmware/Gcode syntax has been extensively used by the RepRap community to simplify the ability to control 3D printing movement. It is important to note though, that Gcode simply encodes for firing of electrical pulses in a predefined manner. So, even though Gcode was not designed for controlling a laser cutter, commands can be co-opted for unorthodox uses if the controller board is correctly wired to the laser cutter.
 
Below is a list of Gcode commands specific to our laser cutter/Marlin firmware setup with accompanying arguments and descriptions.

- M3
	o Turn laser on with current laser settings
	o Laser settings can be specified with an M3 command, but if a setting is not specified, the previously used value will be used.
- M5
	o *****Turn laser off
- G0
	o Move without laser on
	o Behaves identically with old marlin Gcode
- G1
	o Move with laser on
	o Uses previously stored laser settings

- G92
	o Set Coordinates
	o Takes X, Y, and Z arguments
- G90
	o Set absolute coordinates
	o G0/G1 commands with X, Y, and Z will specify absolute coordinate locations
	o i.e. if you enter G0 X1 Y2 Z3 twice, the first command will move to (1,2,3) and the second command will not move (because you are already at the specified locations)
- G91
	o Set relative coordinates
	o G0/G1 commands with X,Y, and Z will specify a relative movement direction
	o i.e. G0 X1 Y2 Z3 twice will move in a <1,2,3> vector direction twice to a final destination of (2, 4, 6) relative to the initial position
- M84 
	o Turn motors off



Laser Cutter Firing Mechanism (Laser Power)

PWM/Laser Firing Profile
Laser Intensity is determined by pulse width modulation (PWM) of signals sent from the Arduino controller to the laser. The Arduino can send two voltage intensities to the laser cutter through the RAMBo microcontroller: a high and a low voltage. To modulate laser intensity with higher precision than on or off, the Arduino can send modulated square waves with controlled relative proportions of high vs. low signal that are integrated into an analog signal of approx. constant voltage by a capacitor (See PWM figure below).

Essentially, the laser accepts signals at a frequency determined by the internal capacitor. During each cycle, there are subcycles during which the signal can be a high or low voltage.  The new firmware by Tim attempts to maximize control over laser intensity signaling by computing the smallest subcycle possible as determined from the physical capacitor and the Arduino processing power. Our laser cutter was similar to Tim’s laser cutter, so we estimated the capacitor frequency to be 25kHz. The Arduino has 16 MHz computing speed, so the number of subcycles possible are 16MHz / 25kHz = 640. By dividing the power range (0 to 100%) by 640, we calculate the approximate resolution of the power setting to be about 0.15625. Tim suggested that the resolution is probably about 0.2.
 
Laser settings can be changed in the Laser.cpp file (Ex. Capacitor frequency and Arduino Computing speed)
 
Beam Types
There are three potential beam types in the current marlin configuration: Continuous, Pulsed, and Raster.  
1) The continuous mode is the traditional laser cutting mode; i.e. during a movement, the laser is continuously open.
2) The pulsed mode only fires the laser a set number of pulses per millimeter of movement,
	a. At low enough speeds (still relatively faster than previous ablation speeds), there is very nice ablation of the surface. 
	b. This mode was determined to be extremely useful for my project.
3) The raster code is not fully functional yet, and I don’t anticipate using that setting for my project, so I won’t discuss it here. 


Signal firing characterization by oscilloscope observation
Background
We know nothing about the actual signals being conveyed from the RAMBo microcontroller to the laser cutter. Thus, I used an oscilloscope to generally observe output signals from the microcontroller in response to various basic GCODE commands.

	• M3 [timed laser fire command] does not pause the command execution queue
		? Movement commands will be executed immediately causing possible movement while laser is still firing

Solution: Insert a G4 [pause] command after every M3 command to force a pause in the GCODE for the M3 laser fire. 
NOTE: G4 [pause] command cannot pause for less than 16 ms in actuality (even if less time is specified).

	• If laser intensity is set, G0 movements become laser on movements (I have no idea why)
	
Solution: Manually set power to 0 by command “M3 S0 L10000”.


PWM Intensity Resolution
Background
It is also important to understand the resolution of the laser power intensity setting. From a signal standpoint, this means the smallest difference in input power settings that is distinguishable. To test this, I simply took measurements of the baseline PWM firing signal after changing the laser power. The microcontroller is constantly sending the intensity signal, so no code was needed to make measurements.

As a note, intensity can be effectively changed by issuing an M3 command like so:
"M3 Sx"

Where x denotes the Pulse Width Modulation ratio (PWM) in %.

System has integer value resolution of PWM settings with 0.1% accuracy

S1 is the lowest observable signal on the oscilloscope.
S1 input ? 1.1% output
S2 input ? 2.0% output
S1.5 input ? 1.1% output
S12 input ? 12% output

Further testing may yield different results, but tentatively, integer values of power input should safely give accuracy of +/- 0.1% power.

Power Resolution

Background
Laser signal PWM input does not necessarily correlate perfectly to max power. Here I measured the actual power output at different % power input settings to empirically determine actual power output. Unfortunately with a high powered laser, I cannot test the power at the focal region without potentially destroying the power meter. So, I placed the power meter on the laser cutter bed as far from the focal zone as possible to take power measurements.
